The insurance industry faces significant financial losses every year due to fraudulent claims. Detecting such fraud has become increasingly difficult, requiring substantial resources and manpower to track transactions. In this project, we aim to tackle this challenge by using machine learning to identify fraud based on insurance company transactional data. We developed predictive models and compared their performance using a confusion matrix, assessing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the AUC curve. 
The models used were  KMeans , Support Vector Machine (SVM) and XGBoost.  The best-performing model successfully predicted fraudulent activity and was deployed as a cloud-based API using the Flask web framework.
